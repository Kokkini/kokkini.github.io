# Quickstart: Basic Landing Page with Game Cards

1. Prepare game list with route, title, description, imagePath, and imageAlt.
2. Add cards to the landing page using semantic HTML.
3. Ensure each image is a link that opens in a new tab to the same-domain route.
4. Verify keyboard navigation and focus states on links.
5. Test responsiveness from 320px upwards; avoid horizontal scroll on mobile.
6. Optimize images for size and clarity; confirm alt text quality.
