# Research: Basic Landing Page with Game Cards

## Decision

Use semantic HTML and accessible interactive elements for card images linking to
same-domain routes, with responsive CSS grid layout and optimized images.

## Rationale

This approach keeps the page lightweight, improves accessibility, and satisfies
the constitution’s principles for performance and simplicity.

## Alternatives Considered

- Heavy UI frameworks or component libraries: unnecessary for scope and could
  increase load time
- Client-side routing or SPA: not required since links navigate to separate
  routes; simple links suffice
